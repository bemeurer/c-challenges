# P Challenges

This is a set programming challenges, solved in C and Rust.

## How to

0. Set up a repository
    * `git init` should do the trick. Commit often
0. Understand the problem
    * Use Generally Useful Resources&trade; to find out more information about
    what you're facing. If you need, use paper, draw diagrams, bite pencils.
    If the problem seems too difficult try to simplify it, find a special case 
    that may be easier to design and implement. If it seems too easy,
    generalise, invent more complicated variations, perhaps try to combine with
    other problems.
0. Implement
    * Start with whatever language you know best or feel most comfortable with.
    If the problem is easy, pick a language you've never used before or one
    that you don't know too well yet. Don't be afraid to write ugly or
    nonidiomatic code as long as you understand what's going on. You can clear
    up the mess later.
0. Test
    * Write tests that check both the ordinary and exceptional cases of your
    program. Compile/interpret/eval whatever you've written and run the tests.
    Find bugs, fix them, and repeat. Again, commit often lest your progress
    disappear into the abbys.
0. Reimplement
    * Now that you have a reference implementation, you can go wild.
    Reimplement the task in a different language this time, perhaps the one
    you've been meaning to learn for years now. Try to achieve the same outcome
    using different techniques, use different idioms. Try to make the code as
    short as possible or the contrary.
